FERemoteClient
==============

JavaFX based client to use the ForgeEssentials remote API.

It allows easy management of FE-based servers, without the need to log into the server.

Currently only works with Java8 until we figure out how to get it running on Java7.

Builds can be temporarily be grabbed from here (no guarantee that they are always up-to-date !!!)
